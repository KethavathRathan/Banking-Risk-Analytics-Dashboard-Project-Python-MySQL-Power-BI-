# Banking Risk Analytics & Dashboard Project(Python | MySQL | Power BI)
## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize banking data for better decision-making using Python, MySQL, and Power BI — helping banks assess customer profiles, monitor loans and deposits, and reduce financial risk.
## Input Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/KethavathRathan/Banking-Risk-Analytics-Dashboard-Project-Python-MySQL-Power-BI-/blob/main/input%20Banking.xlsx"> Input Banking Dataset</a>
##  Tools Used
- Python 🐍 – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- MySQL 💾 – Managed and queried relational banking data using SQL joins and aggregations.
- Power BI 📊 – Created interactive dashboards and visualized key banking KPIs and insights.
- Pandas – Processed and structured raw datasets efficiently during analysis.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Built calculated measures and KPIs in Power BI for dynamic reporting.

##  Major Skills Applied
- Data Cleaning & Preparation – Removed inconsistencies, handled missing data, and prepared datasets for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified patterns, relationships, and trends in the data using Python.
- SQL Querying – Extracted, joined, and aggregated data efficiently for analysis.
- Dashboard Development – Designed interactive, data-driven dashboards in Power BI.
- Business Insight Generation 💡 – Interpreted analytical results to support strategic decision-making.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Features
Multi-page interactive dashboard:
- 🏠 Home Overview – All KPIs in one view
- 💰 Loan Analysis – Breakdown by gender, nationality, and bank type
- 🏦 Deposit Analysis – Deposit patterns and balance comparison
- 📋 Summary Page – Combined insights and performance overview
